title: Interactional Sound and Music
----

>    *Interactional - capable of acting on or influencing each other*

The Interactional Sound and Music group in the Centre for Digital Music explores new ways of encountering sound from interactive art to real time data sonification.

We ask questions such as: How do we design and create engaging interactive soundscapes? What encourages collective action with, and through sound? Does music make the world go round? Can data be sonified beautifully and intuitively? How can algorithms improvise with us in real-time? What do people understand of our new forms of musical expression. How does technology change the music making process? Can we sense the imperceptible? What do diagrams sound like?
