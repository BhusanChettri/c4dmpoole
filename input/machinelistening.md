title: Machine Listening
----

In the Machine Listening area we concentrate on the automatic analysis and understanding of musical and and other sounds from the world around us.

We use a wide variety of techniques to analyse sounds, including: short-time Fourier transforms (STFTs), wavelets, cosine packets, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), hidden Markov models, Bayesian models, sinusoidal analysis, independent component analysis, dynamic Bayesian networks, and sparse representations.

Projects in this area include:

* Information Dynamics of Music
* Beat Tracking and Rhythmic Analysis
* Sparse Representations for Audio Source Separation
* Compressed Sensing of Audio Scenes
* Automated Composition
* Machine Listening using Sparse Representations
* Interactive Real-time Musical Systems
* Musical Audio Analysis for Real-Time Interaction
* Real-Time Analysis of Voice for Musical Applications
* Musical Audio Stream Separation
* Sparse Object-Based Coding of Music
