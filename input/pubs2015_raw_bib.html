  abstract = { This paper presents a Bayesian probabilistic framework for real-time alignment of a recording or score with a live performance using an event-based approach. Multitrack audio files are processed using existing onset detection and harmonic analysis algorithms to create a representation of a musical performance as a sequence of time-stamped events. We propose the use of distributions for the position and relative speed which are sequentially updated in real-time according to Bayesâ€™ theorem. We develop the methodology for this approach by describing its application in the case of matching a single MIDI track and then extend this to the case of multitrack recordings. An evaluation is presented that contrasts ourmultitrack alignment method with state-of-the-art alignment techniques. }

  abstract = {Many current paradigms for acoustic event detection (AED) are not adapted to the organic variability of natural sounds, and/or they assume a limit on the number of simultaneous sources: often only one source, or one source of each type, may be active. These aspects are highly undesirable for applications such as bird population monitoring. We introduce a simple method modelling the onsets, durations and offsets of acoustic events to avoid intrinsic limits on polyphony or on inter-event temporal patterns. We evaluate the method in a case study with over 3000 zebra finch calls. In comparison against a HMM-based method we find it more accurate at recovering acoustic events, and more robust for estimating calling rates. }

  abstract = {For intelligent systems to make best use of the audio modality, it is important that they can recognise not just
speech and music, which have been researched as specific tasks, but also general sounds in everyday environments.
To stimulate research in this field we conducted a public research challenge: the IEEE Audio and Acoustic Signal
Processing Technical Committee challenge on Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE).
In this paper we report on the state of the art in automatically classifying audio scenes, and automatically detecting
and classifying audio events. We survey prior work as well as the state of the art represented by the submissions to
the challenge from various research groups. We also provide detail on the organisation of the challenge, so that our
experience as challenge hosts may be useful to those organising challenges in similar domains. We created new audio
datasets and baseline systems for the challenge: these, as well as some submitted systems, are publicly available
under open licenses, to serve as benchmark for further research in general-purpose machine listening.}
