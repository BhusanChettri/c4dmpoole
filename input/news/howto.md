title: News How-To
---

C4DM MEMBERS: here's how to contribute a [news](news/) item:

1. Make sure you're logged in to Github
2. Visit [https://github.com/c4dm/c4dmpoole/new/master/input/news](https://github.com/c4dm/c4dmpoole/new/master/input/news)
3. Where it says "Name your file" use a filename like this:

       `news.YYYY-MM-DD.Great_Thing_Happens.md`
       
   (with the desired date, and the desired headline such as "Great Thing Happens" in this example)

4. If you have permission you can directly save it. If not, github will create a "Pull Request" which one of the C4DM site maintainers will check and merge in.
