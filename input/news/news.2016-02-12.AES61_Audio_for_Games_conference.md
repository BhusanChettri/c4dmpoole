title: AES61 Audio for Games 2016
-------------------

The 61th International Conference of the Audio Engineering Society on Audio for Games took place in London from 10 to 12 February. 
This is the fifth edition of the Audio for Games conference which features a mixture of invited talks and academic paper sessions. Traditionally a biennial event, by popular demand the conference was organised in 2016 again following a very successful 4th edition in 2015. 
As with many AES conferences, C4DM was well represented both in the conference organisation and the programme. 

First of all, **Christian Heinrichs** presented work from his doctoral research with **Andrew McPherson**, discussing [Digital Foley](http://www.audioforgames.net/2016/timetable/#DigitalFoley) and introducing FoleyDesigner, which allows for effectively using human gestures to control sound effects models. 


**David Moffat** and **William Wilkinson** both presented a paper in the [Synthesis and Sound Design](http://www.audioforgames.net/2016/schedule-papers/#Paper4) paper session, on weapon sounds and mammalian growls respectively, both of which can be found in the conference proceedings.

Furthermore, Xavier Serra and Frederic Font presented the [Audio Commons](http://www.audiocommons.org) project and [how the creative industries could benefit from and get access to content with liberal licenses](http://www.audioforgames.net/2016/schedule-papers/#Paper2). **George Fazekas** and (ex-C4DM) **Mark Plumbley** are coauthors of this paper. 
The project was also presented in a seminar at C4DM on Tuesday 9 February.

Like last year, AES [Student representatives](http://www.aes.org/students/sda/officers.cfm) and QMUL PhD students **Brecht De Man** and **David Moffat** were part of the conference's organising committee, led by chair Michael Kelly. **David Ronan** also volunteered to take care of the video recording - hopefully made available soon.
